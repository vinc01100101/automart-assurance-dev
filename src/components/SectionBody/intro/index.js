                Mabuhay Insurance Agency Corporation is a sister company of
                Qmarketz Corporation who produced Automart.Ph and Motomart.Ph.
                Automart.Ph is the largest online seller in the Philippines of
                repossessed cars. Motomart has the same concept but selling
                repossessed motorcycles instead. Our branches are located
                nationwide. With the growing footprint of Automart.Ph and
                Motomart.pH with respect to car and motorcycle sales,
                Assurance.Ph was conceptualized to service the insurance
                requirements of our buyers. Car dealerships in the Philippines
                traditionally have their own agencies and insurance partners so
                it was timely that in the third year of Automart and its
                nationwide recognition, Assurance was born.
