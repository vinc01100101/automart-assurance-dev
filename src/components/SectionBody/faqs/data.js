Besides, if you are charged, you must pay for your own vehicle's maintenance as well as legal costs.

At the minimum, all vehicle owners like you must get Compulsory Third Party Liability Insurance (CTPL), which covers death and injury of third parties (or, people who are not your passengers and were involved in the accident). At the most, you may get comprehensive insurance that may cover you for a wider range of financial protection.`,

CTPL insurance is LTO-mandated coverage and is a key feature in your policy (obligatory, not optional). It only provides financial protection for death indemnity, bodily injury, and permanent disablement to third parties involved in an accident. Meaning, you, as the driver, and your passengers, won't be covered for medical and hospital care if an accident occurs (your expenses will be out-of-pocket).`,
