                        Most insurance companies insure vehicles up to 10-12
                        years old; any vehicle older than that may come with a
                        higher annual premium payment (and more requirements, or
                        require specialist insurance).

                        Insurance policies tend to give most people the idea
                        that filing a claim is more complicated than it truly
                        is. It is not complicated at all, but yes, it will
                        require some paperwork. For starters, all you have to do
                        is report the incident as soon as possible so this is
                        lodged by the insurance company.{" "}
