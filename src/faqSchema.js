1. Enter your personal information then choose a location and time of your choice for the inspection and appraisal. In Metro Manila, slots are available every day, from 9AM to 4PM. For Davao, slots are available only on Fridays, and in Cebu, TBA.

2. Meetup with our adviser the pre-purchase car inspection, appraisal, and price negotiation.

3. Go home and relax while we sell your car, normally within one
              week.

4. Sign the deed of sale and get your money.

5. Want to trade-in? Buy your next car from us and get an additional P10,000 of credit."
